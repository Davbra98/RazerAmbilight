# Usage:
Simply install and start via the desktop icon.
If you want to stop the effect, right-click the icon in the tray and press Exit.

# Notes:
During the installation, an autostart entry is defined, whereby the program starts automatically when Windows starts. You can deactivate this in the Task Manager in the auto start tab. 

The update rate determines after how many milliseconds the effect should be updated.
