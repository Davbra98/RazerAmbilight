# RazerAmbilight
A background process that creates an ambilight effect for razer keyboards.

# Usage:
To use the effect, simply run Ambilight.exe. This then opens the process in the background. Until now, this can only be terminated via the Task Manager.

Optional command line arguments: ambilight.exe \<quality\> \<updateRate\>

The quality determines how many pixels are to be viewed for the effect. The default value is 10; the quality becomes better for smaller values, while the processor load suffers at smaller values.
The update rate determines after how many milliseconds the effect should be updated.
