# RazerAmbilight
A background process that creates an ambilight effect for razer keyboards.
(tested with a Razer ornata chroma and a screen resolution of 1920*1080 pixels)

# Usage:
To use the effect, simply run Ambilight.exe. This then opens the process in the background. Until now, this can only be terminated via the Task Manager.

Optional command line arguments: ambilight.exe \<updateRate\>

The update rate determines after how many milliseconds the effect should be updated.
